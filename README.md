My background is in logistics and operations. I have experience in leading a team in a large-scale operation to deliver safe, efficient, and on-time logistics support to meet customer's needs profitably.
I have recently enrolled in Code:You to learn data analytics, web development, and software development and am looking to transition into a more long-term career that will allow my natural skills to thrive as well as continued improvement, education, and growth.
